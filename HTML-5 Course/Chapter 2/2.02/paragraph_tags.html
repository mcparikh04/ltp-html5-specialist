        <p>The text that you put inside of a paragraph tag is very imporant and the text written automatically shows up on the screen.</p>
        <p>If you make a new paragraph tag, a space is made and the next text is put below it. If the text takes up more than one horizontal line, the text here will go to another. </p>
