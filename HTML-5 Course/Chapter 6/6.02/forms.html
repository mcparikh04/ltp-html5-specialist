        </form>
        <p>The action processes the form. "#" means no action. The method takes whatever the user types and puts it into the http headers. There is "post" and "get". Get takes the text and puts it straight into the URL. This is less common because if there are security issues, it is a problem becuase anyone can see it. </p>
